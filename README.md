# open-dis-languages
Parent repo with submodules for each language implementation of Distributed Interactive Simulation, IEEE-1278.1. This simplifies getting all language implementations, should you want to.  

At least with the current Mac version of git, once the open-dis-languages repo
is cloned you should do a  

git submodule init  
git submodule update  

To pull down the contents of the submodules, ie the individual language
implementations. If you don't do this, the language directories will
appear to be empty. It's rumored that this is taken care of for you
automatically in more recent versions of git.
